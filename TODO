# General
- simple gui for asking where the tts savefiles are located
- REST API for savefile push / pull

# Design principles

- broker is the single source of truth
    - it knows if TTS is running a 'stale' file
    - it notifies subscribers of new changes
    - the subscribers need to handle updates: discard changes, override, create copy
